# `stimgen.StimPlay`

`stimgen.StimPlay` is the scheduling wrapper that sits between a stimulus
definition and the playback tools.

The class does not generate waveforms on its own. Instead, it wraps one
`stimgen.StimType` object, adds repetition and order state, and exposes the
currently selected presentable waveform through dependent properties such as
`CurrentStimObj` and `Signal`.

## Why this wrapper exists

The playback controllers in `stimgen` need more than a waveform.

They also need to know:

- how many times the wrapped stimulus should be presented
- how long to wait between presentations
- which member of a multi-object sweep should be presented next
- what order the individual presentations occurred in

`StimPlay` centralizes that state so playback GUIs do not each have to solve
the same bookkeeping problem.

## Single-object and multi-object behavior

`StimPlay` supports two shapes of wrapped stimulus.

### Single-object stimulus

For a normal stimulus such as `stimgen.Tone` or `stimgen.Noise`, `StimObj`
is the presentable object. `CurrentStimObj` simply returns that same object.

### Multi-object stimulus

For a stimulus whose `IsMultiObj` property is true, the real presentable
objects live in `StimObj.MultiObjects`.

In that case, `StimPlay` uses `StimIdx` to select one child object at a time
and exposes the selected child through `CurrentStimObj`.

That is how one multi-object definition can behave like many presentable
stimuli during playback. (For most sweep-style needs, prefer the variant
selection built into `stimgen.StimType` — vectorized properties with
`VariantSelectionMode` — described in
[stimgen_StimType.md](stimgen_StimType.md).)

## Key properties

- `StimObj`: the wrapped `StimType` object
- `Reps`: target repetitions per presentable stimulus
- `ISI`: scalar or two-element range in seconds (GUIs enter it in ms)
- `SelectionType`: `"Serial"` or `"Shuffle"`
- `RepsPresented`: per-stimulus presentation counts
- `StimIdx`: current child index inside the wrapped stimulus
- `StimOrder`: logged order of internal child selections

Useful dependent properties:

- `CurrentStimObj`
- `Signal`
- `NStimObj`
- `StimPresented`
- `StimTotal`
- `LastStim`

## Scheduling behavior

### `reset()`

`reset()` regenerates the wrapped stimulus signal, resets `StimIdx` to `1`,
zeros `RepsPresented`, and allocates a fresh `StimOrder` array.

Playback controllers usually call this before a run starts.

### `increment()`

`increment()` advances the internal selection state.

It chooses the next child index with either:

- `select_Serial()` to pick the first stimulus with the minimum rep count
- `select_Shuffle()` to pick a random stimulus among those with the minimum
  rep count

After selecting an index, the method increments `RepsPresented(idx)` and logs
that index in `StimOrder`.

### `get_isi()`

If `ISI` is a range `[min max]`, `get_isi()` returns a random scalar within
that range. If both values are equal, it returns the fixed value.

## Calibration propagation

Assigning `StimPlay.Calibration` also assigns the same object to the wrapped
stimulus.

That forwarding step is important because playback controllers typically work
with `StimPlay` arrays, while waveform scaling happens inside the underlying
`StimType` objects.

## Common usage

Wrap a simple tone:

```matlab
tone = stimgen.Tone;
tone.Frequency = 4000;
tone.SoundLevel = 60;

sp = stimgen.StimPlay(tone);
sp.Reps = 10;
sp.ISI = [0.8 1.2];
sp.SelectionType = "Serial";
sp.reset();
```

## Serialization

`toStruct()` serializes the scheduling state plus the wrapped stimulus.

For single-object stimuli, the wrapped object is serialized directly through
`StimType.toStruct()`.

For multi-object stimuli, `StimPlay.toStruct()` serializes the expanded child
objects rather than the original wrapper object.

### Persistence caveat

That flattening makes sense for presentation logs, but it also means save/load
paths that expect a single `StimObj.Class` are easiest to use with
single-object stimuli. If you rely on round-tripping multi-object stimuli
through a saved bank or config file, test that workflow before depending on
it.
